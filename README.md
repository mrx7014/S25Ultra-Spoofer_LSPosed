# S25Ultra-Spoofer LSPosed

## What is S25Ultra-Spoofer?
S25Ultra-Spoofer is a module for LSPosed that lets you spoof all device-specific properties of your device, selectively for individual apps, to a high end Samsung device

## How to install
### Prerequisites
To use this module you must have one of the following (latest versions):
- [Magisk](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk) with Zygisk enabled
    - IMPORTANT: DO NOT add apps that you want to spoof to Magisk's denyList as that will break the module.
- [KernelSU](https://github.com/tiann/KernelSU) with [ZygiskNext](https://github.com/Dr-TSNG/ZygiskNext) module installed
- [APatch](https://github.com/bmax121/APatch) with [ZygiskNext MOD](https://github.com/Yervant7/ZygiskNext) module installed
You must also have [LSPosed](https://github.com/mywalkb/LSPosed_mod) installed

### Installation
- Download the latest APK of S25UltraSpoofer from the [releases section](https://github.com/mrx7014/S25Ultra-Spoofer_LSPosed/releases) and install it like any normal APK.
- Now open the LSPosed Manager and go to "Modules".
- S25UltraSpoofer should now appear in that list.
- Click on S24UltraSpoofer and enable the module by flipping the switch at the top that says "Enable module".
- Next, tick all the apps that you want to spoof details for and reboot your phone afterwards.
